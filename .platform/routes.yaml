# The 'Catch all' routes at the bottom of this file will generate routes for all sites whose domain
# name has been added to the 'domains' section on the Platform.sh dashboard i.e. all sites that are 'live'.
# Note that, for these live sites, all URLs will also be correctly generated for their other Platform sites
# such as UAT and Edge.
#
# The only sites that need to be explicitly listed here are those that are not yet fully 'live' i.e. their
# domain name has not yet been added to the 'domains' section of the Platform.sh dashboard. For these sites
# an 'upstream' entry should be added for the 'www' version of the site and a 'redirect' entry should also
# be added.
