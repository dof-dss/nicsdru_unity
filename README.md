# Unity sites codebase

[![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/johangant/nicsdru_unity.svg?style=svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/johangant/nicsdru_unity)

This source code is for the Unity sites. It is built with Drupal 8 in a multisite configuration.

It is hosted on platform.sh.

Continuous Integration and Deployment services are provided by Circle CI.

## Getting started

We recommend Lando for local development. To get started, ensure you have the following installed:

1. Lando [https://docs.devwithlando.io/](https://docs.devwithlando.io/)
2. Composer [https://getcomposer.org/](https://getcomposer.org/)
3. Platform CLI tool [https://docs.platform.sh/development/cli.html](https://docs.platform.sh/development/cli.html)

- `lando start`

Once ready, you will need to either install Drupal from existing configuration (no content):

`lando drush si --existing-config`

Or, if available, you may also fetch the database and import this:

`platform db:dump --stdout unity-db.sql | lando db-import unity-db.sql` (you'll need to specify project ID and environment ID)

Avoid retrieving any managed files. You should be accessing these via the stage_file_proxy module. If this isn't working,
 check the configuration for it.

## Code workflow

Like the popular git-flow workflow, but without the more complex elements:

- `development` bleeding-edge. All feature branches originate from here.
- `master` stable, automatically deployed to platform.sh. Release tags should originate from here.

Preferred feature branch naming convention: `TICKET_REF-short-desc`, for example: `D8UN-123-event-listing`

We highly recommend developers use a tool such as [Talisman](https://github.com/thoughtworks/talisman) to ensure they do not commit potentially sensitive material into the codebase.

API keys, auth tokens or other credentials values *must* be stored as environment variables and never stored in the codebase itself.

## Talisman pre-commit hooks

- We *strongly* recommend developers use Talisman when working on this project.
- Talisman validates the outgoing change set for things that look suspicious - such as authorization tokens and private keys.
